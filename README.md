# UI/UX Notes

A place for me to dump all my things I am learning about UI/UX


## Forms
- Single column forms are much better for usability and decrease the chance of users misunderstanding the sequential flow of the form.
- Long forms should be broken into smaller parts to increase user completion rate
    - A stepper is a great way of breaking your form into smaller easier to complete steps. 
## Type

- Font size
  - body text 16px you can not go wrong with - usually header should be around 2.5x the size of the body text (40px) in this case - that should be 1rem vs 2.5rem
  - Prefer smaller line height on larger text, increase line height on paragraphs to make more legible

## Misc

- Do not use high contrast borders they draw unecessary attention from your eyes
- Borders in most case are unnecessary noise that does not contribute to the design
    - using the law of proximity can aleviate a lot of the problems that borders are trying to solve.
    - using borders can be fine in some cases when they are low contrast
- Religious Debates 
    - People think everyone on the web thinks in the way that they do, if I dont like it nobody will 
    - You can sit and argue design decisions but the only thing that will really help is user testing
