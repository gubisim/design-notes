# UI/UX Notes
A place for me to dump all my things I am learning about UI/UX

## Type
- do not use high contrast borders they draw unecessary attention from your eyes

- Font size 
    - body text 16px you can not go wrong with - usually header should be around 2.5x the size of the body text (40px) in this case - that should be 1rem vs 2.5rem 
    - Prefer smaller line height on larger text, increase line height on paragraphs to make more legible

## Misc
- using borders is fine as long as they are low contrast
 - Religious Debates - People think everyone on the web thinks in the way that they do, if I dont like it nobody will - You can sit and argue design decisions but the only thing that will really help is user testing
